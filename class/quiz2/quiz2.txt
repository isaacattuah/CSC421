Copy this file to your own _username_/quiz2/ folder. Do not modify
anything in the class folder, else subversion will stop your commits! 
Put your name where it says "Name".


Concerning Makefile:

1) What does the "words" target do? 
   Why are the words printed in the correct order?

2) Change the target to write "is The price right!"

2) What does the count target do?
   What idea was used to printout a count.
   
3) Modify the count target to count by 7's starting and 7 and ending at 21.

4) What does the target hello do?

Concerning Makefile-hello

5) Based on the hello target in Makefile, write a makefile that builds
   a program like the hello.c program, but instead of hello world, prints
   out whatever is in the greetings-file.txt file.

   a- correct behavior should rebuilt the hello.c file when the 
      greetings-file.txt file changes.
   b- correct behavior should rebuid hello when hello.c changes.
   c- correct behavior should not rebuild things unnecessarily.
   d- correct behavior will create a clean target that cleans up the
      build products
   e- correct solutions should fill in the created and last updated 
      with the student name, and some revision/creation date.
